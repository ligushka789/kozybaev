### Understanding International Food Adaptation

This data analysis project addresses the challenges faced by **international students and visitors** when selecting meals in the United States.  
Many newcomers struggle to adjust to unfamiliar food environments due to differences in:

- **Affordability** — Navigating food prices and budget-friendly options  
- **Cultural norms** — Adapting to eating habits, flavors, and meal times  
- **Dietary habits** — Balancing traditional preferences with available ingredients  

While existing tools like nutrition apps, campus dining plans, and general food guidelines offer useful insights, they often **fail to address the unique intersection of culture, health, and cost** that international visitors must manage.

Our project uses **data analysis and visualization** to explore these issues and provide **actionable insights** for better meal planning and adaptation in a new country.
